     * Description for get(...), set(...) and getFromBufferDescriptorInfo(...)
     *
     * ------------ Overview -----------------------------------
     * Gralloc 4 adds support for getting and setting buffer metadata on a buffer.
     *
     * To get buffer metadata, the client passes in a buffer handle and a token that
     * represents the type of buffer metadata they would like to get. IMapper returns
     * a byte stream that contains the buffer metadata. To set the buffer metadata, the
     * client passes in a buffer handle and a token that represents the type of buffer
     * metadata they would like to set and a byte stream that contains the buffer metadata
     * they are setting.
     *
     * Buffer metadata is global for a buffer. When the metadata is set on the buffer
     * in a process, the updated metadata should be available to all other processes.
     * Please see "Storing and Propagating Metadata" below for more details.
     *
     * The getter and setter functions have been optimized for easy vendor extension.
     * They do not require a formal extension to add support for getting and setting
     * vendor defined buffer metadata. See "Buffer Metadata Token" and
     * "Buffer Metadata Stream" below for more details.
     *
     * ------------ Storing and Propagating Metadata -----------
     * Buffer metadata must be global. Any changes to the metadata must be propagated
     * to all other processes immediately. Vendors may chose how they would like support
     * this functionality.
     *
     * We recommend supporting this functionality by allocating an extra page of shared
     * memory and storing it in the buffer's native_handle_t. The buffer metadata can
     * be stored in the extra page of shared memory. Set operations are automatically
     * propagated to all other processes.
     *
     * ------------ Buffer Metadata Synchronization ------------
     * There are no explicit buffer metadata synchronization primitives. Many devices
     * before gralloc 4 already support getting and setting of global buffer metadata
     * with no explicit synchronization primitives. Adding synchronization primitives
     * would just add unnecessary complexity.
     *
     * The general rule is if a process has permission to write to a buffer, they
     * have permission to write to the buffer's writable metadata. If a process has permission
     * to read from a buffer, they have permission to read the buffer's metadata.
     *
     * There is one exception to this rule. Fences CANNOT be used to protect a buffer's
     * metadata. A process should finish writing to a buffer's metadata before
     * sending the buffer to another process that will read or write to the buffer.
     * This exception is needed because sometimes userspace needs to read the
     * buffer's metadata before the buffer's contents are ready.
     *
     * As a simple example: an app renders to a buffer and then displays the buffer.
     * In this example when the app renders to the buffer, both the buffer and its
     * metadata need to be updated. The app's process queues up its work on the GPU
     * and gets back an acquire fence. The app's process must update the buffer's
     * metadata before enqueuing the buffer to SurfaceFlinger. The app process CANNOT
     * update the buffer's metadata after enqueuing the buffer. When HardwareComposer
     * receives the buffer, it is immediately safe to read the buffer's metadata
     * and use it to program the display driver. To read the buffer's contents,
     * display driver must still wait on the acquire fence.
     *
     * ------------ Buffer Metadata Token ----------------------
     * In order to allow arbitrary vendor defined metadata, the token used to access
     * metadata is defined defined as a struct that has a string representing
     * the enum type and an int that represents the enum value. The string protects
     * different enum values from colliding.
     *
     * The token struct (MetadataType) is defined as a C struct since it
     * is passed into a C function. The standard buffer metadata types are NOT
     * defined as a C enum but instead as an AIDL enum to allow for broader usage across
     * other HALs and libraries. By putting the enum in the
     * stable AIDL (hardware/interfaces/graphics/common/aidl/android/hardware/
     * graphics/common/StandardMetadataType.aidl), vendors will be able to optionally
     * choose to support future standard buffer metadata types without upgrading
     * IMapper versions. For more information see the description of "struct MetadataType".
     *
     * ------------ Buffer Metadata Stream ---------------------
     * The buffer metadata is get and set as a void* buffer. By getting
     * and setting buffer metadata as a generic buffer, vendors can use the standard
     * getters and setter functions defined here. Vendors do NOT need to add their own
     * getters and setter functions for each new type of buffer metadata.
     *
     * Converting buffer metadata into a byte stream can be non-trivial. For the standard
     * buffer metadata types defined in StandardMetadataType.aidl, there are also
     * support functions that will encode the buffer metadata into a byte stream
     * and decode the buffer metadata from a byte stream. We STRONGLY recommend using
     * these support functions. The framework will use them when getting and setting
     * metadata. The support functions are defined in
     * frameworks/native/libs/gralloc/types/include/gralloctypes/Gralloc4.h.
