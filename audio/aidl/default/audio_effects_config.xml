    <!-- Overview.
         This example config file was copy from existing one: frameworks/av/media/libeffects/data/
         audio_effects.xml, with effect library names updated to AIDL libraries we currently have.

         All "library" attributes in "effect" element must must match a "library" element with the
         same value of the "name" attribute.
         All "effect" attributes in "preprocess" and "postprocess" element must match an "effect"
         element with the same value of the "name" attribute.

         AIDL EffectFactory are relying on the "name" attribute in "effect" element to identify the
         effect type, so it's necessary to have the mapping from name to effect type UUID. Make
         sure to either use existing effect name as key of
         ::android::hardware::audio::effect::kUuidNameTypeMap, or add a new {name, typeUUID} map
         item to the kUuidNameTypeMap.

         Existing audio_effects.xml should working without any change as long as:
         1. "path" attribute of "library" element matches with the actual effect library name.
         2. "name" attribute of "effect" and "effectProxy" element correctly added as key of
            kUuidNameTypeMap, with value matches Identity.type in Descriptor.aidl.
         3. "uuid" attribute of "effect" element matches Identity.uuid in Descriptor.aidl.
         4. "uuid" attribute of "effectProxy" element matches Identity.proxy in Descriptor.aidl.

    <!-- list of effects to load.
         Each "effect" element must contain a "name", "library" and a "uuid" attribute.
         The value of the "library" attribute must correspond to the name of one library element in
         the "libraries" element.
         The "name" attribute used to specific effect type, and should be mapping to a key of
         aidl::android::hardware::audio::effect::kUuidNameTypeMap.
         The "uuid" attribute is the implementation specific UUID as specified by the effect vendor.

         Effect proxy can be supported with "effectProxy" element, each sub-element should contain
         "library" and "uuid" attribute, all other attributes were ignored. Framework side use
         result of IFactory.queryEffects() to decide which effect implementation should be part of
         proxy and which not.

         Only "name", "library", and "uuid" attributes in "effects" element are meaningful and
         parsed out by EffectConfig class, all other attributes are ignored.
         Only "name" and "uuid" attributes in "effectProxy" element are meaningful and parsed out

    <!-- Audio pre processor configurations.
         The pre processor configuration is described in a "preprocess" element and consists in a
         list of elements each describing pre processor settings for a given use case or "stream".
         Each stream element has a "type" attribute corresponding to the input source used.
         Valid types are these defined in system/hardware/interfaces/media/aidl/android/media/audio/
         common/AudioSource.aidl.
         Each "stream" element contains a list of "apply" elements indicating one effect to apply.
         The effect to apply is designated by its name in the "effects" elements.
         If there are more than one effect apply to one stream, the audio framework will apply them
         in the same equence as they listed in "stream" element.

         Each stream element has a "type" attribute corresponding to the stream type used.
