/**
 * KeyMint device definition.
 *
 * == Features ==
 *
 * An IKeyMintDevice provides cryptographic services, including the following categories of
 * operations:
 *
 * o   Key generation
 * o   Import of asymmetric keys
 * o   Import of raw symmetric keys
 * o   Asymmetric decryption with appropriate padding modes
 * o   Asymmetric signing with digesting and appropriate padding modes
 * o   Symmetric encryption and decryption in appropriate modes, including an AEAD mode
 * o   Generation and verification of symmetric message authentication codes
 * o   Attestation to the presence and configuration of asymmetric keys.
 *
 * Protocol elements, such as purpose, mode and padding, as well as access control constraints, must
 * be specified by the caller when keys are generated or imported and must be permanently bound to
 * the key, ensuring that the key cannot be used in any other way.
 *
 * In addition to the list above, IKeyMintDevice implementations must provide one more service
 * which is not exposed as an API but used internally: Random number generation.  The random number
 * generator must be high-quality and must be used for generation of keys, initialization vectors,
 * random padding and other elements of secure protocols that require randomness.
 *
 * == Types of IKeyMintDevices ==
 *
 * All of the operations and storage of key material must occur in a secure environment.  Secure
 * environments may be either:
 *
 * 1.  Isolated execution environments, such as a separate virtual machine, hypervisor or
 *      purpose-built trusted execution environment like ARM TrustZone.  The isolated environment
 *      must provide complete separation from the Android kernel and user space (collectively called
 *      the "non-secure world", or NSW) so that nothing running in the NSW can observe or manipulate
 *      the results of any computation in the isolated environment.  Isolated execution environments
 *      are identified by the SecurityLevel TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT.
 *
 * 2.  Completely separate, purpose-built and certified secure CPUs, called "StrongBox" devices.
 *      Examples of StrongBox devices are embedded Secure Elements (eSE) or on-SoC secure processing
 *      units (iSE).  StrongBox environments are identified by the SecurityLevel STRONGBOX.  To
 *      qualify as a StrongBox, a device must meet the requirements specified in CDD 9.11.2.
 *
 * == Necessary Primitives ==
 *
 * All IKeyMintDevice implementations must provide support for the following:
 *
 * o   RSA
 *
 *      - TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT IKeyMintDevices must support 2048, 3072 and 4096-bit keys.
 *        STRONGBOX IKeyMintDevices must support 2048-bit keys.
 *      - Public exponent F4 (2^16+1)
 *      - Unpadded, RSASSA-PSS and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 padding modes for RSA signing
 *      - TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT IKeyMintDevices must support MD5, SHA1, SHA-2 224, SHA-2 256, SHA-2
 *        384 and SHA-2 512 digest modes for RSA signing.  STRONGBOX IKeyMintDevices must support
 *        SHA-2 256.
 *      - Unpadded, RSAES-OAEP and RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 padding modes for RSA encryption.
 *
 * o   ECDSA
 *
 *      - TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT IKeyMintDevices must support NIST curves P-224, P-256, P-384 and
 *        P-521.  STRONGBOX IKeyMintDevices must support NIST curve P-256.
 *      - TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT IKeyMintDevices must support SHA1, SHA-2 224, SHA-2 256, SHA-2
 *        384 and SHA-2 512 digest modes.  STRONGBOX IKeyMintDevices must support SHA-2 256.
 *
 * o   AES
 *
 *      - TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT IKeyMintDevices must support 128, 192 and 256-bit keys.
 *        STRONGBOX IKeyMintDevices must only support 128 and 256-bit keys.
 *      - CBC, CTR, ECB and GCM modes.  The GCM mode must not allow the use of tags smaller than 96
 *        bits or nonce lengths other than 96 bits.
 *      - CBC and ECB modes must support unpadded and PKCS7 padding modes.  With no padding CBC and
 *        ECB-mode operations must fail with ErrorCode::INVALID_INPUT_LENGTH if the input isn't a
 *        multiple of the AES block size.  With PKCS7 padding, GCM and CTR operations must fail with
 *        ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_PADDING_MODE.
 *
 * o   3DES
 *
 *      - 168-bit keys.
 *      - CBC and ECB mode.
 *      - CBC and ECB modes must support unpadded and PKCS7 padding modes.  With no padding CBC and
 *        ECB-mode operations must fail with ErrorCode::INVALID_INPUT_LENGTH if the input isn't a
 *        multiple of the DES block size.
 *
 * o   HMAC
 *
 *      - Any key size that is between 64 and 512 bits (inclusive) and a multiple of 8 must be
 *        supported.  STRONGBOX IKeyMintDevices must not support keys larger than 512 bits.
 *      - TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT IKeyMintDevices must support MD-5, SHA1, SHA-2-224, SHA-2-256,
 *        SHA-2-384 and SHA-2-512.  STRONGBOX IKeyMintDevices must support SHA-2-256.
 *
 * == Key Access Control ==
 *
 * Hardware-based keys that can never be extracted from the device don't provide much security if an
 * attacker can use them at will (though they're more secure than keys which can be
 * exfiltrated).  Therefore, IKeyMintDevice must enforce access controls.
 *
 * Access controls are defined as "authorization lists" of tag/value pairs.  Authorization tags are
 * 32-bit integers from the Tag enum, and the values are a variety of types, defined in the TagType
 * enum.  Some tags may be repeated to specify multiple values.  Whether a tag may be repeated is
 * specified in the documentation for the tag and in the TagType.  When a key is created or
 * imported, the caller specifies a `key_description` authorization list.  The IKeyMintDevice must
 * determine which tags it can and cannot enforce, and at what SecurityLevel, and return an array of
 * `KeyCharacteristics` structures that contains everything it will enforce, associated with the
 * appropriate security level, which is one of SOFTWARE, TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT and STRONGBOX.
 * Typically, implementations will only return a single KeyCharacteristics structure, because
 * everything they enforce is enforced at the same security level.  There may be cases, however, for
 * which multiple security levels are relevant. One example is that of a StrongBox IKeyMintDevice
 * that relies on a TEE to enforce biometric user authentication.  In that case, the generate/import
 * methods must return two KeyCharacteristics structs, one with SecurityLevel::TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT
 * and the biometric authentication-related tags, and another with SecurityLevel::STRONGBOX and
 * everything else.  The IKeyMintDevice must also add the following authorizations to the
 * appropriate list:
 *
 * o    Tag::OS_VERSION
 * o    Tag::OS_PATCHLEVEL
 * o    Tag::VENDOR_PATCHLEVEL
 * o    Tag::BOOT_PATCHLEVEL
 * o    Tag::ORIGIN
 *
 * The IKeyMintDevice must ignore unknown tags.
 *
 * The caller may provide the current date time in the keyParameter CREATION_DATETIME tag, but
 * this is optional and informational only.
 *
 * All authorization tags and their values enforced by an IKeyMintDevice must be cryptographically
 * bound to the private/secret key material such that any modification of the portion of the key
 * blob that contains the authorization list makes it impossible for the secure environment to
 * obtain the private/secret key material.  The recommended approach to meet this requirement is to
 * use the full set of authorization tags associated with a key as input to a secure key derivation
 * function used to derive a key (the KEK) that is used to encrypt the private/secret key material.
 * Note that it is NOT acceptable to use a static KEK to encrypt the private/secret key material
 * with an AEAD cipher mode, using the enforced authorization tags as AAD.  This is because
 * Tag::APPLICATION_DATA must not be included in the authorization tags stored in the key blob, but
 * must be provided by the caller for every use.  Assuming the Tag::APPLICATION_DATA value has
 * sufficient entropy, this provides a cryptographic guarantee that an attacker cannot use a key
 * without knowing the Tag::APPLICATION_DATA value, even if they compromise the IKeyMintDevice.
 *
 * IKeyMintDevice implementations must ignore any tags they cannot enforce and must not return them
 * in KeyCharacteristics.  For example, Tag::ORIGINATION_EXPIRE_DATETIME provides the date and time
 * after which a key may not be used to encrypt or sign new messages.  Unless the IKeyMintDevice has
 * access to a secure source of current date/time information, it is not possible for the
 * IKeyMintDevice to enforce this tag.  An IKeyMintDevice implementation will not rely on the
 * non-secure world's notion of time, because it could be controlled by an attacker. Similarly, it
 * cannot rely on GPSr time, even if it has exclusive control of the GPSr, because that might be
 * spoofed by attacker RF signals.
 *
 * Some tags must be enforced by the IKeyMintDevice.  See the detailed documentation on each Tag
 * in Tag.aidl.
 *
 * == Root of Trust Binding ==
 *
 * IKeyMintDevice keys must be bound to a root of trust, which is a bitstring that must be
 * provided to the secure environment (by an unspecified, implementation-defined mechanism) during
 * startup, preferably by the bootloader.  This bitstring must be cryptographically bound to every
 * key managed by the IKeyMintDevice.  As above, the recommended mechanism for this cryptographic
 * binding is to include the Root of Trust data in the input to the key derivation function used to
 * derive a key that is used to encrypt the private/secret key material.
 *
 * The root of trust consists of a bitstring that must be derived from the public key used by
 * Verified Boot to verify the signature on the boot image and from the lock state of the
 * device.  If the public key is changed to allow a different system image to be used or if the
 * lock state is changed, then all of the IKeyMintDevice-protected keys created by the previous
 * system state must be unusable, unless the previous state is restored.  The goal is to increase
 * the value of the software-enforced key access controls by making it impossible for an attacker-
 * installed operating system to use IKeyMintDevice keys.
 *
 * == Version Binding ==
 *
 * All keys must also be bound to the operating system and patch level of the system image and the
 * patch levels of the vendor image and boot image.  This ensures that an attacker who discovers a
 * weakness in an old version of the software cannot roll a device back to the vulnerable version
 * and use keys created with the newer version.  In addition, when a key with a given version and
 * patch level is used on a device that has been upgraded to a newer version or patch level, the
 * key must be upgraded (See IKeyMintDevice::upgradeKey()) before it can be used, and the previous
 * version of the key must be invalidated.  In this way, as the device is upgraded, the keys will
 * "ratchet" forward along with the device, but any reversion of the device to a previous release
 * will cause the keys to be unusable.
 *
 * This version information must be associated with every key as a set of tag/value pairs in the
 * hardwareEnforced authorization list.  Tag::OS_VERSION, Tag::OS_PATCHLEVEL,
 * Tag::VENDOR_PATCHLEVEL, and Tag::BOOT_PATCHLEVEL must be cryptographically bound to every
 * IKeyMintDevice key, as described in the Key Access Control section above.

     *   except AGREE_KEY must be supported for RSA keys.
     *
     * o Tag::DIGEST specifies digest algorithms that may be used with the new key.  TEE

     * == Authorization Enforcement ==
     *
     * The following key authorization parameters must be enforced by the IKeyMintDevice secure
     * environment if the tags were returned in the "hardwareEnforced" list in the
     * KeyCharacteristics.
     *
     * -- All Key Types --
     *
     * The tags in this section apply to all key types.  See below for additional key type-specific
     * tags.
     *
     * o Tag::PURPOSE: The purpose specified in the begin() call must match one of the purposes in
     *   the key authorizations.  If the specified purpose does not match, begin() must return
     *   ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_PURPOSE.
     *
     * o Tag::ACTIVE_DATETIME can only be enforced if a trusted UTC time source is available.  If
     *   the current date and time is prior to the tag value, begin() must return
     *   ErrorCode::KEY_NOT_YET_VALID.
     *
     * o Tag::ORIGINATION_EXPIRE_DATETIME can only be enforced if a trusted UTC time source is
     *   available.  If the current date and time is later than the tag value and the purpose is
     *   KeyPurpose::ENCRYPT or KeyPurpose::SIGN, begin() must return ErrorCode::KEY_EXPIRED.
     *
     * o Tag::USAGE_EXPIRE_DATETIME can only be enforced if a trusted UTC time source is
     *   available.  If the current date and time is later than the tag value and the purpose is
     *   KeyPurpose::DECRYPT or KeyPurpose::VERIFY, begin() must return ErrorCode::KEY_EXPIRED.
     *
     * o Tag::MAX_USES_PER_BOOT must be compared against a secure counter that tracks the uses of
     *   the key since boot time.  If the count of previous uses exceeds the tag value, begin() must
     *   return ErrorCode::KEY_MAX_OPS_EXCEEDED.
     *
     * o Tag::USER_SECURE_ID must be enforced by this method if and only if the key also has
     *   Tag::AUTH_TIMEOUT (if it does not have Tag::AUTH_TIMEOUT, the Tag::USER_SECURE_ID
     *   requirement must be enforced by updateAad(), update() and finish()).  If the key has both,
     *   then this method must receive a non-empty HardwareAuthToken in the authToken argument.  For
     *   the auth token to be valid, all of the following have to be true:
     *
     *   o The HMAC field must validate correctly.
     *
     *   o At least one of the Tag::USER_SECURE_ID values from the key must match at least one of
     *     the secure ID values in the token.
     *
     *   o The key must have a Tag::USER_AUTH_TYPE that matches the auth type in the token.
     *
     *   o The timestamp in the auth token plus the value of the Tag::AUTH_TIMEOUT must be less than
     *     the current secure timestamp (which is a monotonic timer counting milliseconds since
     *     boot.)
     *
     *   If any of these conditions are not met, begin() must return
     *   ErrorCode::KEY_USER_NOT_AUTHENTICATED.
     *
     * o Tag::CALLER_NONCE allows the caller to specify a nonce or initialization vector (IV).  If
     *   the key doesn't have this tag, but the caller provided Tag::NONCE to this method,
     *   ErrorCode::CALLER_NONCE_PROHIBITED must be returned.
     *
     * o Tag::BOOTLOADER_ONLY specifies that only the bootloader may use the key.  If this method is
     *   called with a bootloader-only key after the bootloader has finished executing, it must
     *   return ErrorCode::INVALID_KEY_BLOB.  The mechanism for notifying the IKeyMintDevice that
     *   the bootloader has finished executing is implementation-defined.
     *
     * -- RSA Keys --
     *
     * All RSA key operations must specify exactly one padding mode in params.  If unspecified or
     * specified more than once, the begin() must return ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_PADDING_MODE.
     *
     * RSA signing operations need a digest, as do RSA encryption and decryption operations with
     * OAEP padding mode.  For those cases, the caller must specify exactly one digest in params.
     * If unspecified or specified more than once, begin() must return
     * ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_DIGEST.
     *
     * Private key operations (KeyPurpose::DECRYPT and KeyPurpose::SIGN) need authorization of
     * digest and padding, which means that the key authorizations need to contain the specified
     * values.  If not, begin() must return ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_DIGEST or
     * ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_PADDING_MODE, as appropriate.
     *
     * With the exception of PaddingMode::NONE, all RSA padding modes are applicable only to certain
     * purposes.  Specifically, PaddingMode::RSA_PKCS1_1_5_SIGN and PaddingMode::RSA_PSS only
     * support signing, while PaddingMode::RSA_PKCS1_1_5_ENCRYPT and PaddingMode::RSA_OAEP only
     * support encryption and decryption.  begin() must return ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_PADDING_MODE
     * if the specified mode does not support the specified purpose.
     *
     * There are some important interactions between padding modes and digests:
     *
     * o PaddingMode::NONE indicates that a "raw" RSA operation is performed.  If signing,
     *   Digest::NONE is specified for the digest.  No digest is necessary for unpadded encryption
     *   or decryption.
     *
     * o PaddingMode::RSA_PKCS1_1_5_SIGN padding requires a digest.  The digest may be Digest::NONE,
     *   in which case the KeyMint implementation cannot build a proper PKCS#1 v1.5 signature
     *   structure, because it cannot add the DigestInfo structure.  Instead, the IKeyMintDevice
     *   must construct 0x00 || 0x01 || PS || 0x00 || M, where M is the provided message and PS is a
     *   random padding string at least eight bytes in length.  The size of the RSA key has to be at
     *   least 11 bytes larger than the message, otherwise begin() must return
     *   ErrorCode::INVALID_INPUT_LENGTH.
     *
     * o PaddingMode::RSA_PKCS1_1_1_5_ENCRYPT padding does not require a digest.
     *
     * o PaddingMode::RSA_PSS padding requires a digest, which must match one of the padding values
     *   in the key authorizations, and which may not be Digest::NONE.  begin() must return
     *   ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_DIGEST if this is not the case.  In addition, the size of the RSA
     *   key must be at least 2 + D bytes larger than the output size of the digest, where D is the
     *   size of the digest, in bytes.  Otherwise begin() must return
     *   ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_DIGEST.  The salt size must be D.
     *
     * o PaddingMode::RSA_OAEP padding requires a digest, which must match one of the padding values
     *   in the key authorizations, and which may not be Digest::NONE.  begin() must return
     *   ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_DIGEST if this is not the case.  RSA_OAEP padding also requires an
     *   MGF1 digest, specified with Tag::RSA_OAEP_MGF_DIGEST, which must match one of the MGF1
     *   padding values in the key authorizations and which may not be Digest::NONE.  begin() must
     *   return ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_MGF_DIGEST if this is not the case. The OAEP mask generation
     *   function must be MGF1.
     *
     * -- EC Keys --
     *
     * Private key operations (KeyPurpose::SIGN) need authorization of digest and padding, which
     * means that the key authorizations must contain the specified values.  If not, begin() must
     * return ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_DIGEST.
     *
     * -- AES Keys --
     *
     * AES key operations must specify exactly one block mode (Tag::BLOCK_MODE) and one padding mode
     * (Tag::PADDING) in params.  If either value is unspecified or specified more than once,
     * begin() must return ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_BLOCK_MODE or
     * ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_PADDING_MODE.  The specified modes must be authorized by the key,
     * otherwise begin() must return ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_BLOCK_MODE or
     * ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_PADDING_MODE.
     *
     * If the block mode is BlockMode::GCM, params must specify Tag::MAC_LENGTH, and the specified
     * value must be a multiple of 8 that is not greater than 128 or less than the value of
     * Tag::MIN_MAC_LENGTH in the key authorizations.  For MAC lengths greater than 128 or
     * non-multiples of 8, begin() must return ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_MAC_LENGTH.  For values less
     * than the key's minimum length, begin() must return ErrorCode::INVALID_MAC_LENGTH.
     *
     * If the block mode is BlockMode::GCM or BlockMode::CTR, the specified padding mode must be
     * PaddingMode::NONE.  For BlockMode::ECB or BlockMode::CBC, the mode may be PaddingMode::NONE
     * or PaddingMode::PKCS7.  If the padding mode doesn't meet these conditions, begin() must
     * return ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_PADDING_MODE.
     *
     * If the block mode is BlockMode::CBC, BlockMode::CTR, or BlockMode::GCM, an initialization
     * vector or nonce is required.  In most cases, callers shouldn't provide an IV or nonce and the
     * IKeyMintDevice implementation must generate a random IV or nonce and return it via Tag::NONCE
     * in outParams.  CBC and CTR IVs are 16 bytes.  GCM nonces are 12 bytes.  If the key
     * authorizations contain Tag::CALLER_NONCE, then the caller may provide an IV/nonce with
     * Tag::NONCE in params, which must be of the correct size (if not, return
     * ErrorCode::INVALID_NONCE).  If a nonce is provided when Tag::CALLER_NONCE is not authorized,
     * begin() must return ErrorCode::CALLER_NONCE_PROHIBITED.  If a nonce is not provided when
     * Tag::CALLER_NONCE is authorized, IKeyMintDevice must generate a random IV/nonce.
     *
     * -- 3DES Keys --
     *
     * 3DES key operations must specify exactly one block mode (Tag::BLOCK_MODE) and one padding
     * mode (Tag::PADDING) in params.  If either value is unspecified or specified more than once,
     * begin() must return ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_BLOCK_MODE or
     * ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_PADDING_MODE.  The specified modes must be authorized by the key,
     * otherwise begin() must return ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_BLOCK_MODE or
     * ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_PADDING_MODE.
     *
     * If the block mode is BlockMode::CBC, an initialization vector or nonce is required.  In most
     * cases, callers shouldn't provide an IV or nonce and the IKeyMintDevice implementation must
     * generate a random IV or nonce and return it via Tag::NONCE in outParams.  CBC IVs are 8
     * bytes.  If the key authorizations contain Tag::CALLER_NONCE, then the caller may provide an
     * IV/nonce with Tag::NONCE in params, which must be of the correct size (if not, return
     * ErrorCode::INVALID_NONCE).  If a nonce is provided when Tag::CALLER_NONCE is not authorized,
     * begin() must return ErrorCode::CALLER_NONCE_PROHIBITED.  If a nonce is not provided when
     * Tag::CALLER_NONCE is authorized, IKeyMintDevice must generate a random IV/nonce.
     *
     *
     * -- HMAC keys --
     *
     * HMAC key operations must specify Tag::MAC_LENGTH in params.  The specified value must be a
     * multiple of 8 that is not greater than the digest length or less than the value of
     * Tag::MIN_MAC_LENGTH in the key authorizations.  For MAC lengths greater than the digest
     * length or non-multiples of 8, begin() must return ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_MAC_LENGTH.  For
     * values less than the key's minimum length, begin() must return ErrorCode::INVALID_MAC_LENGTH.
     *
     * @param purpose The purpose of the operation, one of KeyPurpose::ENCRYPT, KeyPurpose::DECRYPT,
     *        KeyPurpose::SIGN, KeyPurpose::VERIFY, or KeyPurpose::AGREE_KEY.  Note that for AEAD
     *        modes, encryption and decryption imply signing and verification, respectively, but
     *        must be specified as KeyPurpose::ENCRYPT and KeyPurpose::DECRYPT.
     *
     * @param keyBlob The opaque key descriptor returned by generateKey() or importKey().  The key
     *        must have a purpose compatible with purpose and all of its usage requirements must be
     *        satisfied, or begin() must return an appropriate error code (see above).
     *
     * @param params Additional parameters for the operation.  If Tag::APPLICATION_ID or
     *        Tag::APPLICATION_DATA were provided during generation, they must be provided here, or
     *        the operation must fail with ErrorCode::INVALID_KEY_BLOB.  For operations that require
     *        a nonce or IV, on keys that were generated with Tag::CALLER_NONCE, params may
     *        contain a tag Tag::NONCE.  If Tag::NONCE is provided for a key without
     *        Tag:CALLER_NONCE, ErrorCode::CALLER_NONCE_PROHIBITED must be returned.
     *
     * @param authToken Authentication token.
     *
     * @return BeginResult as output, which contains the challenge, KeyParameters which haves
     *         additional data from the operation initialization, notably to return the IV or nonce
     *         from operations that generate an IV or nonce, and IKeyMintOperation object pointer
     *         which is used to perform updateAad(), update(), finish() or abort() operations.
