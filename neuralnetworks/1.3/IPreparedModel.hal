     *

     * immediately invoke the callback object provided as an input to the
     * execute_1_3 function. This callback must be provided with the ErrorStatus of
     * the execution.

     *   values, the execution should complete successfully (ErrorStatus::NONE):
     *   There must be no failure unless the device itself is in a bad state.

     * in any combination, may be made concurrently, even on the same
     * IPreparedModel object.

     *                to the execute_1_3 function to the time the driver invokes
