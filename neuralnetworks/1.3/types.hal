     * A recurrent neural network layer that applies a basic RNN cell to a
     * sequence of inputs in forward and backward directions.
     *
     * This Op unrolls the input along the sequence dimension, and implements
     * the following operation for each element in the sequence s =
     * 1...sequence_length:

     *
     * Where:
     * * “{fw,bw}_input_weights” is a weight matrix that multiplies the inputs;
     * * “{fw,bw}_recurrent_weights” is a weight matrix that multiplies the
     *    current “state” which itself is the output from the previous time step
     *    computation;
     * * “{fw,bw}_bias” is a bias vector (added to each output vector in the
     *    batch);
     * * “activation” is the function passed as the “fused_activation_function”
     *   argument (if not “NONE”).
     *
     * The op supports cross-linking via an auxiliary input. Regular cell feeds
     * one input into the two RNN cells in the following way:
     *
     *       INPUT  (INPUT_REVERSED)
     *         |         |

     *      FW_OUT     BW_OUT
     *
     * An op with cross-linking takes two inputs and feeds them into the RNN
     * cells in the following way:
     *
     *       AUX_INPUT   (AUX_INPUT_REVERSED)
     *           |             |

     *    | FW_RNN       BW_RNN |
     *    -----------------------
     *         |           |

     *
     * The cross-linking mode is enabled iff auxiliary input and auxiliary
     * weights are present. While stacking this op on top of itself, this
     * allows to connect both forward and backward outputs from previous cell
     * to the next cell's input.
     *
     * Since HAL version 1.3 parallel linking mode is supported. The mode is
     * enabled if auxiliary input is present but auxiliary weights are omitted.
     * In this case, the cell feeds inputs into the RNN in the following way:
